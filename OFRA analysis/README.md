## Offshore and Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Models: OFRA Analysis

This is an analysis extended from James Broughel's model in this repository.

Key differences from Broughel's original analysis include:

 - Extending the sales simulation from 5 to 10 years;
 - Allowing Reform to differ from Baseline in several dimensions---all adjustable in the new “Scores” spreadsheet in `Onshore Model - extended.xlsx` and `Offshore Model - extended.xlsx`---such as the scale of sales/leases, the activity level, the length of production lag, and oil and gas prices. For example, the revenue difference between Baseline and Reform over 10 years is:
    - $272.1 billion for offshore if (a) there are 20 sales/year for 10 years (under Reform) rather than 1 sale every 2 years for 10 years (under Baseline), (b) the activity level is mid (under Reform) rather than low (under Baseline), (c) the production lag is 5 years (under Reform) rather than 7 years (under Baseline), and (d) the oil and gas prices are $64 and $3.2 (under Reform) rather than $80 and $4 (under Baseline);
    - $77.5 billion for onshore if (b) the activity level under Reform is 4 times of the past-decade high, (c) the production lag is 3 years (under Reform) rather than 5 years (under Baseline), and (d) the oil and gas prices are $64 and $3.2 (under Reform) rather than $80 and $4 (under Baseline).
